# Advent of Code 2023

This is my personal AoC2023 repo. My ambisions are to use various languages for solving the tasks, however most of them will probably be solved using Kotlin 😍

Input files are not pushed to GitHub, and should be placed in ```AdventOfCode2023/input/day<number>/input.txt``` (e.g. ```AdventOfCode2023/input/day3/input.txt``` for day 3).
